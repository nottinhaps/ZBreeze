# ZBreeze

## Introduction

ZBreeze is a keybinding script derived from [Psithurism](https://somyrion.github.io/psithurism/readme.html), built specifically for The Leftist Assembly for Z-Day. It maps actions that will be used often during Z-Day to keys on your keyboard.

For example, if you want to find nations that to target with cure missiles, instead of having to find The Leftist Assembly, scroll down to the World Census Report, sort TLA nations by "Most Zombified", and click on the statistics button, you can simply press `z` once to get to the same page. This will make it much faster to find nations that need curing.

## Installation

ZBreeze is distributed as a userscript, a little bit of code that the user - you - add to your browser. This means that you need to **install the Tampermonkey ([Firefox]() | [Chrome]()) extension first** in order to run it. Tampermonkey allows you to add little pieces of code (like ZBreeze) to your browser and make them act like browser extensions.

If you've previously installed Breeze++ or a similar extension, **make sure to turn it off before using ZBreeze!** Otherwise, they will interfere with each other.

### Once you've done all that, you can click on [here](https://github.com/nottinhaps/ZBreeze/raw/main/ZBreeze.user.js) to install ZBreeze.
